h1. hydra-access-controls

The hydra-access-controls gem provides access controls models and functionality for Hydra Heads.  See the "hydra-head":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head gem and the "Hydra Project website":http://projecthydra.org for more info.

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hydra-access-controls'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hydra-access-controls

h2. Usage

h3. Policy-based Enforcement (or Collecton-level enforcement)

If you have Policy-based enforcement enabled, then objects will inherit extra GRANT permissions from AdminPolicy objects they are linked to with an isGovernedBy RDF relationship (stored in solr as _is_governed_by_s__ field).  This allows you to grant discover/read/edit access for a whole set of objects by changing the policy they are governed by.

AdminPolicy objects store their inheritable rightsMetadata in a datastream called defaultRights.  This datastream uses the regular Hydra rightsMetadata schema.  Each AdminPolicy object also has its own rightsMetadata datasream, like all other Hydra assets, which specifies who is able to _edit_ the Policy or _use_ it (associate it with objects).

Object-level permissions and Policy-level permissions are combined to produce the list of Individuals & Groups who have access to the object.  This means that if _either_ the object's rightsMetadata or the Policy's defaultRights grants access to an Individual or Group, that access will be allowed.

* Currently, an asset can have only one Policy associated with it -- you can't associate objects with multiple policies
* 

To turn on Policy-based enforcement, 

* include the Hydra::PolicyAwareAbility module in your Ability class (Make sure to include it _after_ Hydra::Ability because it overrides some of the methods provided by that module.)
* include the Hydra::PolicyAwareAccessControlsEnforcement module into any appropriate Controllers (or into ApplicationController)
 
# app/models/ability.rb
<pre>
  # Allows you to use CanCan to control access to Models
  require 'cancan'
  class Ability
    include CanCan::Ability
    include Hydra::Ability
    include Hydra::PolicyAwareAbility
  end
</pre>

# app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb
<pre>
  class CatalogController < ApplicationController  

    include Blacklight::Catalog
    include Hydra::Controller::ControllerBehavior
    include Hydra::PolicyAwareAccessControlsEnforcement
    
    # ...
  end
</pre>

h3. Modifying solr field names for enforcement

Hydra uses its own set of default solr field names to track rights-related metadata in solr.  If you want to use your own field names, you can change them in your Hydra config.  You will also have to modify the permissions response handler in your solrconfig.xml to return those fields.

# config/initializers/hydra_config.rb
<pre>
  Hydra.configure(:shared) do |config|
    # ... other stuff ...
    config[:permissions] = {
      :catchall => "access_t",
      :discover => {:group =>"discover_access_group_t", :individual=>"discover_access_person_t"},
      :read => {:group =>"read_access_group_t", :individual=>"read_access_person_t"},
      :edit => {:group =>"edit_access_group_t", :individual=>"edit_access_person_t"},
      :owner => "depositor_t",
      :embargo_release_date => "embargo_release_date_dt"
    }
    config[:permissions][:inheritable] = {
      :catchall => "inheritable_access_t",
      :discover => {:group =>"inheritable_discover_access_group_t", :individual=>"inheritable_discover_access_person_t"},
      :read => {:group =>"inheritable_read_access_group_t", :individual=>"inheritable_read_access_person_t"},
      :edit => {:group =>"inheritable_edit_access_group_t", :individual=>"inheritable_edit_access_person_t"},
      :owner => "inheritable_depositor_t",
      :embargo_release_date => "inheritable_embargo_release_date_dt"
    }
  end
</pre>
