    <param name="doMediateDatastreams" value="false">
      <comment>A boolean switch indicating whether Datastream Mediation is 
	    	activated or not. Datastream Mediation is required if using basic 
	    	authentication for API-A. When basic authentication is enabled for 
	    	API-A, backend services used by custom disseminations may or may not be 
	    	capable of authenticating with the Fedora server. Datastream mediation 
	    	coupled with the backend service configuration information in the 
	    	beSecurity.xml file enables the Fedora server to determine which backend 
	    	services are required to authenticate and which ones are allowed to 
	    	connect without authentication. Datastream mediation provides additional 
	    	repository security by not exposing the physical location of Referenced 
	    	Content datastreams to external mechanisms(services). Instead of 
	    	exposing the actual physical location of Referenced Content datastreams, 
	    	Datastream Mediation functions as a proxy requiring all external 
	    	services to communicate through the Fedora server to resolve the 
	    	location of Referenced Content datastreams. 
	
			IMPORTANT: For Datastream Mediation to function, the Fedora server must 
			be internet accessible using the configured name for fedoraServerHost 
			and fedoraServerPort. For example, using the default fedoraServerHost 
			value of &quot;localhost&quot; will not work if you have remote backend services 
			since the hostname of &quot;localhost&quot; will not be resolvable as the Fedora 
			server by the remote backend services. This requirement can be difficult 
			to satisfy if the Fedora server is located behind a firewall and you do 
			not have ready access to the firewall&apos;s configuration to enable the 
			required access. If the Fedora server is behind a firewall and you have 
			no access to the firewall&apos;s configuration, you are limited to keeping 
			Datastream Mediation turned off. Note that this will also prevent you 
			from using basic authentication with API-A. The default value of 
			doMediateDatastreams is false.</comment>

    <comment>Example local MPTStore backed by Postgres.
		  To use this triplestore for the Resource Index:
		  1) In fedora.fcfg, change the "datastore" parameter of the
		     ResourceIndex module to localPostgresMPTTriplestore.
		  2) Login to your Postgres server as an administrative user and
		     run the following commands:
		       CREATE ROLE "fedoraAdmin" LOGIN PASSWORD 'fedoraAdmin'
		         NOINHERIT CREATEDB
		         VALID UNTIL 'infinity';
		       CREATE DATABASE "riTriples"
		         WITH ENCODING='SQL_ASCII'
		         OWNER="fedoraAdmin";
		  3) Make sure you can login to your Postgres server as fedoraAdmin.
		  4) Download the appropriate Postgres JDBC 3 driver from 
		     http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
		     and make sure it's accessible to your servlet container.
		     If you're running Tomcat, putting it in common/lib/ will work.</comment>
