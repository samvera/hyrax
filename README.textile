h1. Hydra-Head

Hydra-Head is a rails 2 Engine containing the code for a
Ruby on Rails application that functions as a Hydra Head.  The full hydra stack includes the following:

- Blacklight for the User Interface
- Solr for the Search Engine
- ActiveFedora to let the rails application talk to fedora
- OM to streamline the metadata configuration
- Solrizer to write Fedora content to the Solr index
- SolrizerFedora for something.

For a more thorough overview of the Hydra framework, see "HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea/blob/master/HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile

This is (currently) a Ruby on Rails 2 Engines Plugin.  It will soon become a Rails 3 Plugin, which will be distributed as a gem.

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia and University of Hull.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, and Chris Awre.  

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
