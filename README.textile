h2. Installation/Setup

h3. Installation Prerequisites

See "http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites

Ruby 1.9.3+ is required by Hydra-Head release 6.0; RVM is strongly suggested.

h3. Install Rails

Currently hydra-head is compatible with Rails 3.2

<pre>
gem install 'rails' --version '~>3.2.13'
</pre>

h3. Generate a new rails application:

<pre>
rails new my_hydra_head
cd my_hydra_head
</pre>

h3. Install Dependencies

First, add them to the "Gemfile":http://gembundler.com/gemfile.html of your application.  You may already have a Gemfile in the new rails application you just generated; in that case, be sure to add blacklight, hydra-head, devise and the development/test group per below:

<pre>
  source 'http://rubygems.org'

  gem 'rails', '3.2.13'

  gem 'blacklight'
  gem 'hydra-head', '~> 6.2.0'

  # We will assume that you're using sqlite3 for testing/demo,
  # but in a production setup you probably want to use a real sql database like mysql or postgres
  gem 'sqlite3'

  # Rails uses asset pipeline.  You will need these gems for used your assets in development.
  # However, you won't need them in production because they will be precompiled.
  group :assets do
    gem 'sass-rails', '~> 3.2.3'
    gem 'jquery-rails'
  end
</pre>

To install all of the dependencies, run:

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>


h3. Run the generators and migrations:

Run the blacklight generator

<pre>rails g blacklight --devise</pre>

Run the hydra-head generator

<pre>rails g hydra:head -f</pre>

Run the database migrations

<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>

h3. You're done.

Congratulations.  You've set up the code for your Hydra Head.

Read "Tools for Developing and Testing your Application":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Tools-for-Developing-and-Testing-your-Application, then read "How to Get Started":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/How-to-Get-Started to get a sense of what you can do with your Hydra Head.

h2. Modifying and Testing the hydra-head Gem

For those developers who want to or need to work on the hydra-head gem itself, see the "Instructions for Contributors":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/For-Contributors

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia, University of Hull and MediaShelf LLC.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, Chris Awre, and Matt Zumwalt.

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
