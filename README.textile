Hydra-Head is a Ruby-on-Rails gem containing the core code for a web application using the full stack of hydra building blocks.

See the github wikis for information targeted to developers: "http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki
See the duraspace hydra wikis for information at the architecture level: "http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/":http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/

If you are new to Hydra and looking to start a new Hydra head with a set of components that have been tested for compatibility, and for which there will be a documented upgrade path to the next versions, we recommend you use the Hydra gem: https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra

h2. Installation/Setup

This process is covered step-by-step in the "Tutorial: Dive Into Hydra":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/wiki/Dive-into-Hydra

h3. Installation Prerequisites

See "http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites

Ruby 1.9.3+ is required by Hydra-Head release 6+; RVM is strongly suggested.

h3. Install Rails


<pre>
gem install 'rails' --version '~>4.0.0'
</pre>

h3. Generate a new rails application:

<pre>
rails new my_hydra_head
cd my_hydra_head
</pre>

h3. Install Dependencies

First, add them to the "Gemfile":http://gembundler.com/gemfile.html of your application.  The new rails application you just generated will have generated a Gemfile; add blacklight and hydra-head as below:

<pre>
  source 'http://rubygems.org'

  gem 'rails', '4.0.0'

  gem 'blacklight'
  gem 'hydra-head', '~> 7.0.1'

</pre>

To install all of the dependencies, run:

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>


h3. Run the generators and migrations:

Run the blacklight generator

<pre>rails g blacklight:install --devise</pre>

Run the hydra-head generator

<pre>rails g hydra:head -f</pre>

Run the database migrations

<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>

h3. You're done.

Congratulations.  You've set up the code for your Hydra Head.

Read "Tools for Developing and Testing your Application":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Tools-for-Developing-and-Testing-your-Application, then read "How to Get Started":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/How-to-Get-Started to get a sense of what you can do with your Hydra Head.

h2. Modifying and Testing the hydra-head Gem

For those developers who want to or need to work on the hydra-head gem itself, see the "Instructions for Contributors":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/For-Contributors

h3. Design & Strategic Contributions

The Hydra Framework would not exist without the extensive design effort undertaken by representatives of repository initiatives from Stanford University, University of Virginia, University of Hull and MediaShelf LLC.  Contributors to that effort include Tom Cramer, Lynn McRae, Martha Sites, Richard Green, Chris Awre, and Matt Zumwalt.

Thorny Staples from Fedora Commons & DuraSpace deserves special thanks for putting all of these people in the same room together.
