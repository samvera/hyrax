# Wings is a toolkit integrating Valkyrie into Hyrax as a bridge away from the
# hard dependency on ActiveFedora.
#
# Requiring this module with `require 'wings'` injects a variety of behavior
# supporting a gradual transition from existing `ActiveFedora` models and
# persistence middleware to Valkyrie.
#
# `Wings` is primarily an isolating namespace for code intended to be removed
# after a full transition to `Valkyrie` as the persistence middleware for Hyrax.
# Applications may find it useful to depend directly on this code to facilitate
# a smooth code migration, much in the way it is being used in this engine.
# However, these dependencies should be considered temprorary: this code will
# be deprecated for removal in a future release.
#
# @deprecated Wings will be removed when ActiveFedora is no longer supported by Hyrax.
#
# @example casting an ActiveFedora model to Valkyrie
#   work     = GenericWork.create(title: ['Comet in Moominland'])
#   resource = work.valkyrie_resource
#
#   resource.title # => ["Comet in Moominland"]
#   resource.title = ["Mumintrollet på kometjakt"]
#
#   Hyrax.persister.save(resource: resource)
#
#   work.reload
#   work.title # => ["Mumintrollet på kometjakt"]
#
# @example defining a native Valkyrie model for use with Wings
#   # given an `ActiveFodora` model like
#   class Book < ActiveFedora::Base
#     property :author, predicate: ::RDF::URI('http://example.com/ns/author')
#     property :title,  predicate: ::RDF::URI('http://example.com/ns/title')
#   end
#
#   # define a `Valkyrie` model with matching attributes,
#   class BookResource < Hyrax::Resource
#     attribute :author, Valkyrie::Types::String
#     attribute :title,  Valkyrie::Types::String
#   end
#
#   # and register the relationship with `Wings`
#   Wings::ModelRegistry.register(BookResource, Book)
#
#   # `Wings` will cast the `BookResource` to a `Book` to persist via `ActiveFedora`
#   resource = BookResource.new(author: 'Tove Jansson', title: 'Comet in Moominland')
#   adapter  = Wings::Valkyrie::MetadataAdapter.new
#   resource = adapter.persister.save(resource: resource)
#
#   resource.title  # => ["Comet in Moominland"]
#   resource.author # => ["Tove Jansson"]
#
#   resource.is_a?(BookResource) # => true
#
# @see https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Hyrax-Valkyrie+Development+Working+Group
#      for further context regarding the approach
