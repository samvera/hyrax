##
# Wings is a toolkit integrating Valkyrie into Hyrax as a bridge away from the
# hard dependency on ActiveFedora.
#
# Requiring this module with `require 'wings'` injects a variety of behavior
# supporting a gradual transition from existing `ActiveFedora` models and
# persistence middleware to Valkyrie.
#
# `Wings` is primarily an isolating namespace for code intended to be removed
# after a full transition to `Valkyrie` as the persistence middleware for Hyrax.
# Applications may find it useful to depend directly on this code to facilitate
# a smooth code migration, much in the way it is being used in this engine.
# However, these dependencies should be considered temprorary: this code will
# be deprecated for removal in a future release.

#      for further context regarding the approach
