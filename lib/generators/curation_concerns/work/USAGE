    app/actors/curation_concerns/scholarly_paper_actor.rb
    app/controllers/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers_controller.rb
    app/views/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers/.keep

    spec/models/scholarly_paper_spec.rb
    spec/actors/curation_concerns/scholarly_paper_actor_spec.rb
    spec/controllers/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers_controller_spec.rb
