module Hyrax
  ##
  # This is an application-wide publisher for Hyrax's Pub/Sub interface.
  #
  # Hyrax publishes events on a variety of streams. The streams are namespaced
  # using `dry-rb`'s dot notation idiom to help with organization. Namespaces
  # reflect the kinds of resources the event applied to.
  #
  #   - `batch`: events related to the performance of `BatchCreateJob`
  #   - `collection`: events related to the lifecycle of PCDM Collections
  #   - `file`: events related to the lifecycle of File/FileMetadata
  #   - `file.set`: events related to the lifecycle of Hydra Works FileSets
  #   - `object`: events related to the lifecycle of all PCDM Objects
  #
  # Applications *SHOULD* publish events whenever the relevant actions are
  # performed. While Hyrax provides certain out-of-the-box listeners to power
  # (e.g.) notifications, event streams are useful for much more: implementing
  # local logging or instrumentation, adding application-specific callback-like
  # handlers, etc... Ensuring events are consistently published is key to their
  # usefulness.
  #
  # @note this API replaces an older `Hyrax::Callbacks` interface, with added
  #   thread safety and capacity for many listeners on a single publication
  #   stream.
  #
  # @note we call this "Publisher" to differentiate from the `Hyrax::Event`
  #   model. This class is a `Dry::Events` publisher.
  #
  # @todo audit Hyrax code (and dependencies!) for places where events should be
  #   published, but are not.
  #
  # @example publishing an event
  #   publisher = Hyrax::Publisher.instance
  #
  #   publisher.publish('object.deposited', object: deposited_object, user: depositing_user)
  #
  # @example use Hyrax.publisher
  #   Hyrax.publisher.publish('object.deposited', object: deposited_object, user: depositing_user)
  #
  # Below is an example of subscribing using an anonymous block.  A
  # potential disadvantage of an anonymous block is that you cannot
  # easily unsubscribe to that block.
  #
  # @example subscribing to an event type/stream with a block handler
  #   publisher = Hyrax::Publisher.instance
  #
  #   publisher.subscribe('object.deposited') do |event|
  #     do_something(event[:object])
  #   end
  #
  # Below is an example of subscribing using an object.  A potential
  # advantage of subscribing with an object is that you can later
  # unsubscribe the object.
  #
  # @example subscribing to an event type/stream with an event listener.
  #
  #   class EventListener
  #     # @param event [#[]] The given event[:object] should be the deposited object.
  #     def on_object_deposited(event)
  #       do_something(event[:object])
  #     end
  #   end
  #   event_listener = EventListener.new
  #
  #   publisher = Hyrax::Publisher.instance
  #
  #   publisher.subscribe(event_listener)
  #
  #   # The above subscribed event_listener instance will receive an #on_object_deposited message
  #   # with an event that has two keys: `:object` and `:user`
  #   publisher.publish('object.deposited', object: deposited_object, user: depositing_user)
  #
  #   publisher.unsubscribe(event_listener)
