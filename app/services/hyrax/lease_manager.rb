module Hyrax
  ##
  # Provides utilities for managing the lifecycle of an `Hyrax::Lease` on a
  # `Hyrax::Resource`.
  #
  # The lease terminology used here is as follows:
  #
  #    - "Expiration Date" is the day a lease is scheduled to expire.
  #    - "Under Lease" means the lease is "active"; i.e. that its expiration
  #       date is today or later.
  #    - "Applied" means the lease's pre-expiration visibility has been set on
  #      the resource.
  #    - "Released" means the lease's post-expiration visibility has been set on
  #      the resource.
  #    - "Enforced" means the object's visibility matches the pre-expiration
  #      visibility of the lease; i.e. the lease has been applied,
  #      but not released.
  #    - "Deactivate" means that the existing lease will be removed
  #
