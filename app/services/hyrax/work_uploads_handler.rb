  # @api public
  #
  # Mediates uploads to a work.
  #
  # Given an existing Work object, `#add` some set of files, then call `#attach`
  # to handle creation/attachment of File Sets, and trigger persistence of files
  # to the storage backend.
  #
  # This class provides both an interface and a concrete implementation.
  # Applications that want to handle file attachment differently (e.g. by making
  # them completely synchronous, by attaching file sets to a different work
  # attribute, by supporting another file/IO class, etc...) can use a different
  # `Handler` implementation. The only guarantee made by the _interface_ is that
  # the process of persisting the relationship between `work` and the provided
  # `files` will start when `#attach` is called.
  #
  # This base implementation accepts only `Hyrax::UploadedFile` instances and,
  # for each one, creates a `Hyrax::FileSet` with permissions matching those on
  # `work`, and appends that FileSet to `member_ids`. The `FileSet` will be
  # added in the order that the `UploadedFiles` are passed in. If the work has a
  # `nil` `representative_id` and/or `thumbnail_id`, the first `FileSet` will be
  # set to that value. An `IngestJob` will be equeued, for each `FileSet`. When
  # all of the `files` have been processed, the work will be saved with the
  # added members. While this is happening, we take a lock on the work via
  # `Lockable` (Redis/Redlock).
  #
  # This also publishes events as required by `Hyrax.publisher`.
  #
  # @todo make this genuinely retry-able. if we fail after creating some of
  #   the file_sets, but not attaching them to works, we should resolve that
  #   incomplete work on subsequent runs.
  #
  #
  # @example
  #   Hyrax::WorkUploadsHandler.new(work: my_work)
  #     .add(files: [file1, file2])
  #     .attach
  #
  class WorkUploadsHandler
