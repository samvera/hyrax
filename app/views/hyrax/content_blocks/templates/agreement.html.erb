</p>

<h3>Visibility Level: <span class="badge badge-success">PUBLIC</span></h3>
<p>
By choosing the Public option you are allowing anyone in the world to view your submission.   You may choose to apply one of several Creative Commons licenses to your submission, which are explained on the submission form and in the FAQ.  These licenses allow you to set your own terms of use for anyone accessing the submission.  You authorize <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> to distribute your content under the terms of that Creative Commons license and to allow users of <%= ApplicationController.helpers.application_name %> to do the same if your license choice permits that.

If you do not choose a license, you grant to <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> the non-exclusive right to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) worldwide, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only.  You also authorize <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> to allow users of the repository to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) worldwide, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> will clearly identify your name(s) as the author(s) or owner(s) of the submission, and will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to your submission.
</p>

<h3>Visibility Level: <span class="badge badge-info"><%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name.upcase %></span></h3>

<p>
If you select the <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> access option, you have decided to restrict access only to users of <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %>'s network. Your deposit will not be accessible to colleagues or students at other universities or to members of the public. If you want your work to be accessible to the broader scholarly community, you should consider the regular Public option instead.  If you choose, you may also further limit access to specific individuals or groups of individuals at <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %>.
</p>

<p>
By clicking through this license, you grant to <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> the non-exclusive right to reproduce and/or distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) to students, faculty, staff, and walk-in users of the <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> libraries, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only.  If you have limited access to specific individuals or groups, <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> will distribute your submission ONLY to those users.  You also authorize <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> to allow <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> community users of the repository to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) in any format or medium for <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> internal non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> will clearly identify your name(s) as the author(s) or owner(s) of the submission, and will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to your submission.
</p>

<h3>Visibility Level: <span class="badge badge-danger">PRIVATE</span></h3>

<p>

Your deposit will not be accessible to anyone other than yourself. If you want your work to be accessible to the broader scholarly community, you should consider the regular Public or <%= ApplicationController.helpers.institution_name %> settings instead.
