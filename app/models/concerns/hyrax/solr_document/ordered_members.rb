    # Decorates an object responding to `#id` with an `#ordered_member_ids` method.
    #
    # @note this decorator is intended for use with data representations other
    #   than the core model objects, as an alternative to a direct query of the
    #   canonical database. for example, it can be used with `SolrDocument` to
    #   quickly retrieve member order in a way that is compatible with the
    #   fast access required in Blacklight's search contexts.
    #
    # @example
    #   base_document = SolrDocument.new(my_work.to_solr)
    #   solr_document = Hyrax::SolrDocument::OrderedMembers.decorate(base_document)
    #
    #   solr_document.ordered_member_ids # => ['abc', '123']
    #
    class OrderedMembers < Hyrax::ModelDecorator
      ##
      # @note the purpose of this method is to provide fast access to member
      #   order. currently this is achieved by accessing indexed list proxies
      #   from Solr. however, this strategy may change in the future.
      #
      # @return [Enumerable<String>] ids in the order of their membership,
      #   only includes ids of ordered members.
