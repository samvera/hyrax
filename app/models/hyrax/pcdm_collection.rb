  ##
  # Valkyrie model for Collection domain objects in the Hydra Works model.
  #
  # ## Relationships
  #
  # ### Collection and Collection (TBA)
  #
  # ### Collection and Work
  #
  # * Defined: The relationship is defined by the inverse relationship stored in the
  #   work's `:member_of_collection_ids` attribute.
  # * Tested: The work tests the relationship.
  # * Collection to Work: (0..m)  A collection can have many works.
  #
  # @example Get works in a collection:
  #       works = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_child_works(resource: collection)
  #
  # * Work to Collection: (0..m)  A work can be in many collections.
  #   * See Hyrax::Work for code to get and set collections for the work.
  #
  # @note Some collection types limit a work to belong to one and only one collection of that type.
  #
  # ### All children
  #
  # * There are additional methods for finding all children without respect to
  #   the child's type.
  #
  # @example Get works and child collections in a collection using:
  #       members = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_members_of(resource: collection)
  #
  # @see Hyrax::Work
