  ##
  # Valkyrie model for `Work` domain objects in the Hydra Works model.
  #
  # ## Relationships
  #
  # ### Administrative Set and Work
  #
  # * Defined: The relationship is defined by the work's `:admin_set_id` attribute.
  # * Tested: The relationship is tested in shared spec `'a Hyrax::Work'` by testing
  #   `#admin_set_id`.  Shared specs are defined in /lib/hyrax/specs/shared_specs/hydra_works.rb.
  # * Administrative Set to Work: (1..m) An admin set can have many works.
  #   * See Hyrax::AdministrativeSet for code to get works in an admin set.
  # * Work to Administrative Set: (1..1)  A work must be in one and only one admin set.
  #
  # @example Set admin set for a work:
  #       work.admin_set_id = admin_set.id
  # @example Get admin set a work is in:
  #       admin_set = Hyrax.query_service.find_by(id: work.admin_set_id)
  #
  # ### Collection and Work
  #
  # * Defined: The relationship is defined by the work's `:member_of_collection_ids` attribute.
  # * Tested: The relationship is tested in shared spec `'a Hyrax::Work'` by testing
  #   `it_behaves_like 'belongs to collections'`.  Shared specs are defined in /lib/hyrax/specs/shared_specs/hydra_works.rb.
  # * Collection to Work: (0..m)  A collection can have many works.
  #   * See Hyrax::PcdmCollection for code to get works in a collection.
  # * Work to Collection: (0..m)  A work can be in many collections.
  #
  # @example Add a work to a collection using Hyrax::CollectionMemberService (multiple method options)
  #       Hyrax::CollectionMemberService.add_members(collection_id: col.id, members: works, user: current_user)
  # @example Get collections a work is in:
  #       collections = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_collections_for(resource: work)
  #
  # @note Some collection types limit a work to belong to one and only one collection of that type.
  #
  # ### Work and Work
  #
  # * Defined: The relationship is defined in the parent work's `:member_ids` attribute.
  # * Tested: The relationship is tested in shared spec `'a Hyrax::Work'` by testing
  #   `it_behaves_like 'has_members'`.  Shared specs are defined in /lib/hyrax/specs/shared_specs/hydra_works.rb.
  # * Work to child Work: (0..m)  A work can have many child works.
  #
  # @example Add a child work to a work:
  #       Hyrax::Transactions::Container['work_resource.add_to_parent']
  #         .call(child_work, parent_id: parent_work.id, user: current_user)
  # @example Get child works:
  #       works = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_child_works(resource: parent_work)
  #
  # * Work to parent Work: (0..1)  A work can be in at most one parent work.
  #
  # @example Get parent work:
  #       parent_work = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_parent_work(resource: child_work)
  #
  # @note `:member_ids` holds ids of child works and file sets.
  #
  # ### Work and File Set
  #
  # * Defined: The relationship is defined in the parent work's `:member_ids` attribute.
  # * Tested: The relationship is tested in shared spec `'a Hyrax::Work'` by testing
  #   `it_behaves_like 'has_members'`.  Shared specs are defined in /lib/hyrax/specs/shared_specs/hydra_works.rb.
  # * Work to File Set: (0..m)  A work can have many file sets.
  # @example Add a file set to a work (code from Hyrax::WorkUploadsHandler#append_to_work)
  #       work.member_ids << file_set.id
  #       work.representative_id = file_set.id if work.respond_to?(:representative_id) && work.representative_id.blank?
  #       work.thumbnail_id = file_set.id if work.respond_to?(:thumbnail_id) && work.thumbnail_id.blank?
  #       Hyrax.persister.save(resource: work)
  #       Hyrax.publisher.publish('object.metadata.updated', object: work, user: files.first.user)
  # @example Get file sets:
  #       file_sets = Hyrax.custom_queries.find_child_file_sets(resource: work)
  #
  # * File Set to Work: (1..1)  A file set must be in one and only one work.
  #   * See Hyrax::FileSet for code to get the work a file set is in.

  # @todo The description in Hydra::Works Shared Modeling is out of date and uses
  #   terminology to describe the relationships that is no longer used in code.
  #   Update the model and link to it.  This can be a simple relationship diagram
  #   with a link to the original Works Shared Modeling for historical perspective.
