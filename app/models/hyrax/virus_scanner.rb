module Hyrax
  ##
  # The default virus scanner ported from +Hyrax::Works+.
  #
  # If ClamAV is present, it will be used to check for the presence of a virus.
  # If ClamAV is not installed or otherwise not available to your application,
  # +Hyrax::Works+ does no virus checking add assumes files have no viruses.
  #
  # @example to use a virus checker other than Hyrax::VirusScanner:
  #   class MyScanner < Hyrax::Works::VirusScanner
  #     def infected?
  #       my_result = Scanner.check_for_viruses(file)
  #       [return true or false]
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Then set Hyrax::Works to use your scanner either in a config file or initializer:
  #   Hyrax.config.virus_scanner = MyScanner
  #
  class VirusScanner
    attr_reader :file

    ##
    # @api public
    # @param file [String]
    def self.infected?(file)
      new(file).infected?
    end

    def initialize(file)
      @file = file
    end

    # @note Override this method to use your own virus checking software
    #
    # @return [Boolean]
